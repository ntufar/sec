Results of Operations

The Company's net sales for the fiscal year ended December 31, {previous_year}, were $394.3 billion, compared to $365.8 billion for the fiscal year ended December 31, {previous_year-1}. The increase in net sales was primarily due to higher net sales of iPhone, Mac, and Services.

iPhone net sales for the fiscal year ended December 31, {previous_year}, were $200.6 billion, compared to $191.9 billion for the fiscal year ended December 31, {previous_year-1}. The increase in iPhone net sales was primarily due to higher unit sales and higher average selling prices.

Mac net sales for the fiscal year ended December 31, {previous_year}, were $29.4 billion, compared to $28.6 billion for the fiscal year ended December 31, {previous_year-1}. The increase in Mac net sales was primarily due to higher unit sales.

iPad net sales for the fiscal year ended December 31, {previous_year}, were $28.3 billion, compared to $29.4 billion for the fiscal year ended December 31, {previous_year-1}. The decrease in iPad net sales was primarily due to lower unit sales.

Wearables, Home and Accessories net sales for the fiscal year ended December 31, {previous_year}, were $39.8 billion, compared to $38.4 billion for the fiscal year ended December 31, {previous_year-1}. The increase in Wearables, Home and Accessories net sales was primarily due to higher net sales of Apple Watch and AirPods.

Services net sales for the fiscal year ended December 31, {previous_year}, were $78.1 billion, compared to $68.4 billion for the fiscal year ended December 31, {previous_year-1}. The increase in Services net sales was primarily due to higher net sales from the App Store, Apple Music, and iCloud.

Gross Margin

The Company's gross margin for the fiscal year ended December 31, {previous_year}, was 43.0%, compared to 42.1% for the fiscal year ended December 31, {previous_year-1}. The increase in gross margin was primarily due to a favorable mix of products and services.

Operating Expenses

The Company's operating expenses for the fiscal year ended December 31, {previous_year}, were $55.4 billion, compared to $51.8 billion for the fiscal year ended December 31, {previous_year-1}. The increase in operating expenses was primarily due to higher research and development expenses and higher selling, general and administrative expenses.

Research and development expenses for the fiscal year ended December 31, {previous_year}, were $29.9 billion, compared to $26.3 billion for the fiscal year ended December 31, {previous_year-1}.

Selling, general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended December 31, {previous_year}, were $25.5 billion, compared to $25.5 billion for the fiscal year ended December 31, {previous_year-1}. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to higher compensation expenses, partially offset by lower advertising expenses.

The Company's other income, net for the fiscal year ended December 31, {previous_year}, was $1.2 billion, compared to $1.1 billion for the fiscal year ended December 31, {previous_year-1}. The increase in other income, net was primarily due to higher interest income.

The decrease in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities was primarily due to share repurchases and dividend payments, partially offset by cash generated from operations.

The Company's cash flow from operations for the fiscal year ended December 31, {previous_year}, was $110.5 billion, compared to $104.4 billion for the fiscal year ended December 31, {previous_year-1}. The increase in cash flow from operations was primarily due to higher net income and changes in working capital.

The Company's capital expenditures for the fiscal year ended December 31, {previous_year}, were $7.1 billion, compared to $7.3 billion for the fiscal year ended December 31, {previous_year-1}. The decrease in capital expenditures was primarily due to lower spending on retail store construction and corporate facilities.

The Company's share repurchases for the fiscal year ended December 31, {previous_year}, were $77.6 billion, compared to $81.4 billion for the fiscal year ended December 31, {previous_year-1}. The decrease in share repurchases was primarily due to lower average share prices.

The Company's dividend payments for the fiscal year ended December 31, {previous_year}, were $14.8 billion, compared to $14.1 billion for the fiscal year ended December 31, {previous_year-1}. The increase in dividend payments was primarily due to higher dividend rates.
